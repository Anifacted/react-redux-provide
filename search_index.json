\n\nThis library aims to make it as quick and easy as possible to build applications with React and Redux.\nIt enforces a separation of concerns.  It keeps user interface decoupled from application state.  It keeps application state decoupled from data sources.\nBuild your UI with React.\nManage application state with Redux providers.\nPersist and share application state with replication.\nUse pure functions everywhere.\nYou can use this library to build applications of any size and complexity, for the real world or for fun.\nFamiliar with React and Redux (including react-redux)?  You can use your same tools and libraries.  Everything you've learned still applies.  You've probably recognized patterns when connecting Redux to your React components.  You've probably recognized patterns when optimizing updates for efficiency.  This library is an abstraction of these patterns.  By default, it minimizes boilerplate and maximizes efficiency.\nUnfamiliar with React and/or Redux?  This library should hopefully still be easy for you to learn.  Simplicity is key when building software, and this library is as simple as it gets.\nNext: Brief Overview\n"},"brief-overview.html":{"url":"brief-overview.html","title":"Brief Overview","keywords":"","body":"Brief Overview\nWe will be using the following throughout this library's documentation:\n\nECMAScript 2015 - Modern JavaScript.  The programming language used in every example.\nJSX - A JavaScript syntax extension resembling XML, typically used with React.\nReact - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI).\nRedux - A JavaScript library for managing application state.\n\nWe will cover the basics of each as we go along, so if any of this is new to you, you may still understand everything.\nThis library revolves around three principles:\n\nThe UI should be as declarative as possible, a simple composition of components.  Ideally, each component is a pure, stateless function.  A pure, stateless function component will always render the same output when given the same input.  This enforces predictable, well-defined components.\n\nThe UI components should always specify the types of properties they use, as propTypes.  Components use these properties to render and/or update the application state.  A component's properties come from their parent component or a provider instance.  Provider instances exist within the context of the application.\n\nUse any number of Redux stores to manage the state of any number of objects.  An object can represent a user, a document, anything.  A provider is a composition of functions and properties designed to manage these objects.  These functions and properties are specific to Redux - e.g., actions, reducers, etc.  You can have any number of instances of the same provider.  This helps enforce separation of concerns and reusability.\nNote: Providers instantiate as React components need them.  Each provider instance has its own Redux store.  This store is automatically created based on the provider's properties.  You will almost never have to directly access the store.\n\n\nNext: Core Example\n"},"core-example/":{"url":"core-example/","title":"Core Example","keywords":"","body":"Core Example\nThe concepts covered throughout this example are what you'll use the most.  This is what we're going to cover:\n\nManaging the state of a single thing with a set of Redux actions and reducers.\n\nManaging the state of more than one thing using the same set of Redux actions and reducers.\n\nPersisting the state of each thing to a data source using replication.\n\nQuerying the data source for any thing matching some state.\n\nTying everything together in a way that maintains decoupling.\n\n\nLet's get started!\nNext: Managing Some \"Thing\"\n"},"core-example/managing-some-thing.html":{"url":"core-example/managing-some-thing.html","title":"Managing Some \"Thing\"","keywords":"","body":"Managing Some \"Thing\"\nSuppose we have a component that renders some thing.  The component will extract thing from its props (properties) and render it.  We'll also add thing to the component's propTypes so that we know what type of thing the component expects.\n// src/components/SomeThing.js\n\nimport React, { PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nconst SomeThing = ({ thing }) => (\n  \n    Thing is currently: {thing}\n  \n);\n\nSomeThing.propTypes = {\n  thing: PropTypes.string.isRequired\n};\n\nexport default SomeThing;\n\nAnd then suppose we want another component to be able to set the current state of thing.  We'll use a function called setThing.  This is also extracted from the component's props, and we'll add an expected setThing function to its propTypes.  We'll render a button that prompts the user for the next thing when clicked.\n// src/components/SomeThingSetter.js\n\nimport React, { PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nconst SomeThingSetter = ({ setThing }) => (\n   {\n    const thing = window.prompt(`What should thing be?`);\n    setThing(thing);\n  }}>\n    Click me to set thing.\n  \n);\n\nSomeThingSetter.propTypes = {\n  setThing: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n};\n\nexport default SomeThingSetter;\n\nNow we need to create a provider that can manage the state of thing.  For this example, all we need is a setThing action, and a thing reducer.\nLet's break it down, step by step.\nWe'll create a value to represent the type of action taking place.  You can create any number of values to represent any number of action types.  These values will remain constant, which is why they are typically called constants.  For this example, we need just one constant.  Let's call it SET.\nconst SET = 'SET';\n\nNow we need to create the setThing function used within the SomeThingSetter component above.  This function will accept a new thing as an input, and it will return an object containing the new thing along with the SET action type.\nfunction setThing(thing) {\n  return {\n    type: SET,\n    thing\n  };\n}\n\nWe can condense this function into a single line:\nconst setThing = (thing) => ({ type: SET, thing });\n\nThe object returned by the setThing function describes an action taking place.  A provider typically contains an actions object.  The actions object can contain any number of functions like this.\nWith that said, let's create an object called actions and put our setThing function in it.\nconst actions = {\n  setThing: (thing) => ({ type: SET, thing })\n};\n\nNow we need to create a function that might return a new state for some thing.  This function should accept the current state and the action object as inputs.  It should always return either the current state of thing or a new state.  It will return a default thing if the current state is undefined.  And it will return the new thing if the action type matches our SET constant.\nfunction thing(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === SET) {\n    return action.thing;\n  } else if (typeof state === 'undefined') {\n    return 'nothing';\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n\nWe can also condense this function into a single line:\nconst thing = (state = 'nothing', { type, thing }) => type === SET ? thing : state;\n\nThis function is a reducer.  A provider typically contains a reducers object to go with the actions object.  The reducers object can contain any number of functions like this.  Each reducer should be a pure function designed to return some state based on any action type.\nWith that said, let's create an object called reducers and put our thing function in it.\nconst reducers = {\n  thing: (state = 'nothing', { type, thing }) => type === SET ? thing : state\n};\n\nThese sets of actions and reducers become our provider module.  All that's left now is to export these actions and reducers within a single object.\n// src/providers/thing.js\n\nconst SET = 'SET';\n\nconst actions = {\n  setThing: (thing) => ({ type: SET, thing })\n};\n\nconst reducers = {\n  thing: (state = 'nothing', { type, thing }) => type === SET ? thing : state\n};\n\nexport default { actions, reducers };\n\nYou may have noticed the following:\n\nThe SomeThing component's propTypes contains thing, which matches the name of our reducer function.\n\nThe SomeThingSetter component's propTypes contains setThing, which matches the name of our action function.\n\n\nMatching propTypes is how react-redux-provide knows that it should create a shared provider instance for these components.  The SomeThingSetter component will automatically receive the setThing function.  And the SomeThing component will automatically receive the current state of thing.\nNote that components don't receive the same exact actions and reducers functions.  They receive action creator functions and current states for matching keys.  The action creator functions will automatically dispatch (pass) the action object to each reducer.  All you should typically care about is the action objects and the states returned by each reducer.\nAlso note that an internal cache of reducer keys to components allows updates to be as efficient as possible.  The fastest code is code that never runs!\nNext: More Than One \"Thing\"\n"},"core-example/more-than-one-thing.html":{"url":"core-example/more-than-one-thing.html","title":"More Than One \"Thing\"","keywords":"","body":"More Than One \"Thing\"\nSuppose you want to manage more than one thing.  All you do is add a key function to the provider definition.  This key function will receive each matched component instance.  It might look something like this:\nconst key = ({ props }) => `things/${props.thingId || ''}`;\n\nWe'll need to include this key function with the exported provider object:\n// src/providers/thing.js\n\nconst SET = 'SET';\n\nconst key = ({ props }) => `things/${props.thingId || ''}`;\n\nconst actions = {\n  setThing: (thing) => ({ type: SET, thing })\n};\n\nconst reducers = {\n  thing: (state = 'nothing', { type, thing }) => type === SET ? thing : state\n};\n\nexport default { key, actions, reducers };\n\nThis allows us to have a different provider instance assigned to a component depending on the thingId property passed to it.\nNow let's update our components' propTypes to expect the thingId prop.

The application will use the same provider instance for same values returned by the key function.\nNext: Persisting State via Replication\n"},"core-example/persisting-state-via-replication.html":{"url":"core-example/persisting-state-via-replication.html","title":"Persisting State via Replication","keywords":"","body":"Persisting State via Replication\nSuppose you want to save and/or share the current state of each thing whenever it changes.  Replication allows you to do this in a way that keeps your application logic independent from your data sources.  It allows you to:\n\nInstantly swap one data source for another.\nPersist state locally.\nPersist state to some backend via some API.\nShare state in real-time via websockets or other means.\nDo each of the above at the same time.\n\nTo enable replication for a provider, assign a replication object to it.  This object specifies how replicators should behave.  See redux-replicate for the full documentation on this object.\nIn our case, we have a single thing reducer.  With just one reducer, we can replicate the entire state, so we'll set reducerKeys to false within the replication object.  With many reducers, it could make more sense to set reducerKeys to true.  This would replicate each reducer's state upon individual changes rather than the entire state.  You can also use an array of reducerKeys to replicate specific states.\nconst replication = {\n  reducerKeys: false\n};\n\nWe'll need to include this with our thing provider as well.\n// src/providers/thing.js\n\nconst SET = 'SET';\n\nconst key = ({ props }) => `things/${props.thingId || ''}`;\n\nconst actions = {\n  setThing: (thing) => ({ type: SET, thing })\n};\n\nconst reducers = {\n  thing: (state = 'nothing', { type, thing }) => type === SET ? thing : state\n};\n\nconst replication = {\n  reducerKeys: false\n};\n\nexport default { key, actions, reducers, replication };\n\nIn More Than One \"Thing\", we discussed the purpose of the provider's key function.  The value returned by this function is accessible via store.key.  Replicators can use the store and its key to save/share actions and state changes.  Replicators are like providers in that they're a composition of functions.  Replicators are typically designed to work with any provider.\nSuppose you want to get the initial state of each thing from an API.  A replicator's getInitialState function will receive the store along with a setState function and a setError function.  Let's use this to create our own getInitialState function which will fetch the current state from our API.\nconst getInitialState = ({ store, setState, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(setState)\n    .catch(setError)\n);\n\nFor example, if thingId is \"A\", then the store.key would be things/A and this getInitialState function would fetch the state of thing \"A\" from the API via the URL /api/things/A.  It then attempts to convert the response to JSON which becomes the initial state via setState.  If there's an error, it's caught by setError instead.\nReplicating state changes to the API works similarly.  The onStateChange function receives the same properties as getInitialState plus some others (see full API reference).  For our particular case, we need nextState and create.  The create property will be a function when creating a new provider instance.  This is useful when the client relies on the server's state.  For example, the client can't create and cache the correct store.key without the server returning a new thingId.  The easiest way to achieve this is by calling the thunk API's createInstance function.\nconst onStateChange = ({ store, nextState, create, setState, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}`, {\n    method: create ? 'POST' : 'PATCH',\n    body: JSON.stringify(nextState),\n    headers: {\n      'Accept': 'application/json',\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    }\n  })\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(create || setState)\n    .catch(setError)\n);\n\nIf we're creating a new thing instance, the store.key will be things/, which means we'll POST the nextState to /api/things/.  We expect the server to return JSON containing any missing state - e.g., thingId - which the create function handles.\nIf we're not creating a new thing instance, we're just replicating the new state to the API.  Suppose the state of thing \"A\" has changed.  This onStateChange function would send the nextState to the server as a PATCH request to the URL /api/things/A.\nPutting these two functions together will form our replicator:\n// src/replicators/backend.js\n\nconst getInitialState = ({ store, setState, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(setState)\n    .catch(setError)\n);\n\nconst onStateChange = ({ store, nextState, create, setState, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}`, {\n    method: create ? 'POST' : 'PATCH',\n    body: JSON.stringify(nextState),\n    headers: {\n      'Accept': 'application/json',\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    }\n  })\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(create || setState)\n    .catch(setError)\n);\n\nexport default { getInitialState, onStateChange };\n\nNext: Querying Replicated States\n"},"core-example/querying-replicated-states.html":{"url":"core-example/querying-replicated-states.html","title":"Querying Replicated States","keywords":"","body":"Querying Replicated States\nYou may not care about this topic until later on, but it's good to know about sooner rather than later.\nMost data sources allow you to query for stored data.  In our case, this data represents the states of any number of Redux stores, created by our providers.\nSuppose we want to find each thing with a current state of \"apple\" within this data source.  To enable this within our React components, we first need to add a handleQuery function to our replicator.  This function works like getInitialState, but instead of a setState function, it receives a setResult function.  It also receives a query object and an options object.  The store passed to it is typically a \"base\" store for any matching reducers but its key would be without, for example, a thingId.\nconst toParams = obj => Object.keys(obj)\n  .map(key => `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(obj[key])}`)\n  .join('&');\n\nconst handleQuery = ({ store, query, setResult, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}?${toParams(query)}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(setResult)\n    .catch(setError)\n);\n\nWe will need to export the handleQuery function along with getInitialState and onStateChange:\n// src/replicators/backend.js\n\nconst getInitialState = ({ store, setState, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(setState)\n    .catch(setError)\n);\n\nconst onStateChange = ({ store, nextState, create, setState, setError }) => (\n  fetch(`/api/${store.key}`, {\n    method: create ?

A provider can do essentially anything Redux can do, but it is encapsulated, reusable, extremely declarative, and mostly automatic.\nFor example, you might have a theme provider and a user provider.  These providers are automatically instantiated as needed, so in the case of the user provider, you can have many different instances at the same time to represent multiple users.  Each instance has its own \"store\" and works completely independently of one another, but you can also configure providers to automatically subscribe to and/or find/create/interact with others if necessary.  \"Stores\" are responsible for holding the current state and handling actions to update that state.  The current state and action creators (and any props which might be derived from a combination of state and component props) are automatically mapped to React components as needed.\nA provider is a plain object composed of a handful of different properties (see below).  These properties are designed to work together to represent and manipulate the state of anything within your application.  You can also declaratively replicate the state of any provider instance's store to some database and/or to other clients.  Redux stores are automatically created based on these properties and assigned to each provider instance.\nExample:\nexport default {\n  // the basics\n  actions: { ... },\n  reducers: { ... },\n  merge: { ... },             // optional\n  middleware: [ ... ],        // optional\n  enhancer: () => {},         // optional\n\n  // initialization\n  state: { ... },             // optional, typically set via app config\n  onInstantiated: () => {},   // optional, sometimes set via app config\n  onReady: () => {},          // optional, sometimes set via app config\n\n  // replication\n  key: () => {},              // optional, typically set via app config\n  replication: { ... },       // optional, typically set via app config\n  clientStateKeys: [ ... ],   // optional, sometimes set via app config\n\n  // advanced\n  subscribeTo: { ... },       // optional, typically set via app config\n  subscribers: { ... },       // optional, typically set via app config\n  wait: () => {},             // optional, typically set via app config\n  clear: () => {},            // optional, typically set via app config\n  isGlobal: Boolean           // optional, typically set via app config\n};\n\nNext: The basics\n"},"extended-documentation/what-is-a-provider/the-basics/":{"url":"extended-documentation/what-is-a-provider/the-basics/","title":"The basics","keywords":"","body":"The basics\nFor the most part, your providers will only ever be composed of actions, reducers, and the occasional merge functions.

It allows you declaratively connect application state to data sources and create efficient, scalable, and reliable software with relatively minimal effort.  It allows you to instantly swap one database for another, one websocket implementation for another, or any other use case you can think of.  If you're unfamiliar with replication, Wikipedia's State machine replication page is a good place to start!\nCreating replicators for Redux and using them with providers should hopefully be pretty straightforward.

The readyCallback is called after all of the replicators have fully initialized based on the new key.\nstore.setState (Mixed nextState)\nYou typically shouldn't need to use this, as state changes should almost always occur as a result of store.dispatch(action).  But it may be useful for keeping a store's state synchronized with some data source which doesn't rely on actions.  If using reducerKeys, the nextState is expected to be an object and is merged into the current state, similar to React's setState.  If not using reducerKeys, the nextState replaces the current state entirely.\nstore.watch (String reducerKey, Function handler)\nMostly used internally for watching for whenever some reducer returns a different state so that components can efficiently know when they should update.\nstore.onReady (Function readyCallback)\nYou can use this if you know your replicator(s) asynchronously initialize the store's state and would like to do something immediately after initialization.  The readyCallback will receive the store within an object - e.g., readyCallback({ store }).\nstore.initializedReplication\nIf for some reason you need to know whether or not getInitialState has completed, you can check this boolean property.  It will be true after initialization.\nNext: Counter Example\n"},"extended-documentation/counter-example.html":{"url":"extended-documentation/counter-example.html","title":"Counter example","keywords":"","body":"Counter example\nLet's create a provider that can synchronously and asynchronously increment some count.  We'll control the count with one component and display the current count with another.\n// src/providers/counter.js\n\n// import thunk from 'redux-thunk';  // for async actions\n// as of v6.0, thunk middleware is no longer required\n// since all providers are given their own custom thunk middleware\n// which includes the provider API as a 3rd argument\n\nconst INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';\n\nconst actions = {\n  increment(by = 1) {\n    return { type: INCREMENT, by };\n  },\n\n  incrementAsync(by = 1, delay = 1000) {\n    return dispatch => setTimeout(\n      () => dispatch(actions.increment(by)),\n      delay\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nconst reducers = {\n  count(state = 0, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n      case INCREMENT:\n        return state + action.by;\n\n      default:\n        return state;\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nexport default { actions, reducers };\n\nNow let's see how easy it is to manipulate the count state!  We simply declare propTypes for actions that we want, and components will receive action creators as props.  For example, to dispatch the INCREMENT action asynchronously, all we need to do is declare incrementAsync within our propTypes and eventually call this.props.incrementAsync().\nNote: When providing each action creator to React components, the result of the action creator is automatically wrapped with providerInstance.store.dispatch, so with the following example, when you call this.props.increment(), you're ultimately calling providerInstance.store.dispatch(actions.increment()).\n// src/components/IncrementButtons.js\n\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nexport default class IncrementButtons extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    increment: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\n    incrementAsync: PropTypes.func.isRequired\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n         this.props.increment()}>\n          Increment\n        \n\n         this.props.incrementAsync()}>\n          Increment asynchronously\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nThen to display the current count within some component, simply declare count as a propType!  The component will automatically re-render whenever the count reducer returns a different state.\n// src/components/CurrentCount.js\n\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nexport default class CurrentCount extends Component {\n  static propTypes = {\n    count: PropTypes.number.isRequired\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Current count is {this.props.count}!\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nNow how do we tie everything together?  Easy!  Two methods:\n\nThe easiest and recommended method is to use this library's install module, which automatically wraps all of your React classes with the provide function.  This allows all of your components to be packaged independently of this library.  There's also a chance that future React versions will support this type of enhancement, so this is definitely the recommended method!\nAll you do is import 'react-redux-provide/lib/install' at the top of your main entry (or entries).\n\nNote: If you need to disable the automatic wrapper for specific components (usually 3rd party components), set a static __provide property to false on the component - e.g., SomeComponent.__provide = false.\n\n// src/renderApp.js\n\nimport 'react-redux-provide/lib/install';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport { App } from './components/index';\nimport defaultProps from './defaultProps';\n\nfunction renderApp(props, element = document.getElementById('root')) {\nreturn render(, element);\n}\n\nrenderApp(defaultProps);\n\nexport default renderApp;\n\n\nIf you would rather not use the install module, you can manually wrap each component with the provide function.  In this case, your components will look something like this:\n// src/components/CurrentCount.js\n\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport provide from 'react-redux-provide';\n\nclass CurrentCount extends Component {\nstatic propTypes = {\n  count: PropTypes.number.isRequired\n};\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    \n      Current count is {this.props.count}!\n    \n  );\n}\n};\n\nexport default provide(CurrentCount);\n\nOr if you would prefer to use it as an ES7 decorator:\n// src/components/CurrentCount.js\n\nimport React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport provide from 'react-redux-provide';\n\n@provide\nexport default class CurrentCount extends Component {\nstatic propTypes = {\n  count: PropTypes.number.isRequired\n};\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    \n      Current count is {this.props.count}!\n    \n  );\n}\n};\n\n\n\nAnd now when rendering the application, all we have to do is include a providers prop.\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { render } from 'react-dom';\nimport * as providers from './providers/index';\nimport { App } from './components/index';\n\nfunction renderApp(props, element = document.getElementById('root')) {\n  return render(, element);\n}\n\nrenderApp({ providers });\n\nexport default renderApp;\n\nWe can also customize each provider's initial state.\nrenderApp({\n  providers: {\n    ...providers,\n    counter: {\n      ...providers.counter,\n      state: {\n        count: 42\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nNext: Protips\n"},"extended-documentation/protips.html":{"url":"extended-documentation/protips.html","title":"Protips","keywords":"","body":"Protips\n\nFor most providers, everything might fit within a single file, but you can structure your imports and exports however you want since each provider is ultimately just a single object.\n\nUse provider factories to create providers with unique keys for common use cases.  The array and map providers are good examples.\n// src/providers/todoList.js\n\nimport provideArray from 'provide-array';\n\nconst todoList = provideArray('todoList', 'todoItem', 'todoItemIndex');\n\nexport default todoList;\n\n\nProviders are composable objects!  You can combine as many providers as you need.  This is great when you have core functionality you would like to implement within multiple providers.\n// src/providers/privateResource.js\n\nimport provideResource from 'provide-resource';\nimport provideAuthentication from 'provide-authentication';\n\nconst privateResourceKey = 'privateResource';\nconst resource = provideResource(privateResourceKey);\nconst authentication = provideAuthentication(privateResourceKey);\n\nconst actions = {\n  ...resource.actions,\n  ...authentication.actions\n};\n\nconst reducers = {\n  ...resource.reducers,\n  ...authentication.reducers\n};\n\nconst middleware = [\n  ...resource.middleware,\n  ...authentication.middleware\n];\n\nexport default { actions, reducers, middleware };\n\n\nApps typically only need a components directory and a providers directory.  A themes directory is also recommended!  See provide-theme. Also see Lumbur for some boilerplate (with the Lumburjack generator) to start using this architecture in a matter of minutes.\n\nComponents should have no knowledge of constants used within providers, which leads to a maximum separation of concerns and is always the best design.  Everything (states and action creators) should be obtainable via props such that components simply render the application state and create actions.\n\nThe more people who adopt providers, the better!  The provider paradigm makes it insanely easy to integrate each other's services, build apps around specific providers, or even combine multiple apps and/or services into one.\n\nThere's a shortcut for dispatching actions, which might be useful when writing tests or inter-provider communication.\nInstead of:\n  providerInstance.store.dispatch(providerInstance.actions.doSomething('fun'))\n\nYou can just do this:\n  providerInstance.actionCreators.doSomething('fun')\n\n\nCheck out react-devtools for a closer look at what exactly is going on when using providers!\n\n\n\nNext: Complete list of exports\n"},"extended-documentation/complete-list-of-exports.html":{"url":"extended-documentation/complete-list-of-exports.html","title":"Complete list of exports","keywords":"","body":"Complete list of exports\nOther than the provide function, nearly all of the exports are utility functions.\nprovide\nThe default export which accepts a React class and returns the class wrapped with a higher-order component designed to share and manage application state via context.
